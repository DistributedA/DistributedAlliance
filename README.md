# DistributedAlliance
By solving the problems of blockchain, we solve the problems of society.

Technological development has been advancing forward at an exponential rate, and the past years have been the most extreme. 
In fact, going further, societal and technological transformations will be even more difficult to foresee. After all, we are not far from seeing AI pass Alan Turing test.
Look at the recent presentation by Google CEO 'Google Assistant Making Calls'. 
However, with such rapid pace of development, humanity needs to be extra careful of the consequences of new technology.
This includes redefinition of value of things, changes in social behavior and structures.
Those concepts are crucial not only for the current, but also for future generations. 

Together with the leading specialists from various industries, Distributed Alliance has established as its mission to oversee, 
support and drive forward development of conscious technology in the field of blockchain.
